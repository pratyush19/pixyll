If you are really interested in solving the real world messy big data, then Enron is the best choice. You will get great exposure about the application of data science in the real world. <br/>
In this blog, I will discuss about the Enron dataset. You can download the dataset from [here](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./enron/enron_mail_20150507.tgz). The Enron fraud is a big, messy and totally fascinating story about corporate malfeasance of nearly every imaginable type. The Enron email and financial datasets are also big, messy treasure troves of information, which become much more useful once you know your way around them a bit. <br/>
As the dataset is very large and it may takes an hour to download so, I’ve combined the email and finance data into a single dataset pickle file which you can see [here](). Learn more about python pickle file from [here](https://pythontips.com/2013/08/02/what-is-pickle-in-python/). I have also created [csv file](https://github.com/pratyush19/pratyush19.github.io/blob/master/_posts/2016-09-19-files/enron.csv) from the pickle file to see and visualize the data more clearly.

# About Enron
In 2000, Enron was one of the largest companies in the United States. By 2002, it had collapsed into bankruptcy due to widespread corporate fraud. In the resulting Federal investigation, a significant amount of typically confidential information entered into the public record, including tens of thousands of emails and detailed financial data for top executives.
