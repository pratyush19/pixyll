Hi! I'm Pratyush, a final year undergraduate student at Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee, India. 
<br />
I'm data science enthusiasts with the big interest to discover patterns in the data to make it more valuable for the world and work. I'm working on improving and implementing machine learning in the real world data and see the impact on our knowledge and lives. 
<br />
I love to solve complex problems whose results have a big impact on our lives. In my free time, I do new stuff, play computer games and solve competitive programming. I am curious about making smart devices for our daily lives.
<br/>
I believe everyday there are lots of new things we can learn to be, even a bit, better than the person we were yesterday.
