Hi! I'm Pratyush, a final year undergraduate student at Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee, India. 
<br />
I'm a passionate data scientist with a deep interest in how data shapes our lives. I am always thinking about the ways to apply machine learning to improve all aspects of our knowledge and lives.
<br />
I'm interested in solving complex problems involving machine learning, big data, and analytics, love to do new stuff and puzzles. I am curious about making smart products for our daily lives.
<br/>
I'm a lifelong learner believes everyday there are lots of new things we can learn to be, even a bit, better than the person we were yesterday.
